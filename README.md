## How to use it
Since this image is based on [rocker/verse](https://hub.docker.com/r/rocker/verse/), I suggest their excellent documentation on how to use it:
[Using the RStudio image](https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker/wiki/Using-the-RStudio-image)

```bash
docker pull mavelli/rocker-bayesian

run a container:
```bash

```url
